Checks ContentCatalog.txt file automatically when launched.

Starfield currently has an issue that causes corruption of a file called ContentCatalog.txt when you load a save game.
This tool is intended to repair the catalog file. You could simply delete the catalog file and have the game rebuild it, but that will force a download of all your Creations mods next time you use the Creations menu.

If downloading the compiled version of the tool, extract the files somewhere and run setup.exe. A desktop shortcut will be created and the tool can be un-installed via the Settings->Apps->Installed apps menu in Windows.

A msi installer is provided as an option. Un-install any previous version first before using this option for the first time. Subsequent updates should upgrade automatically.

Enable all the checkboxes under Auto Functions to have the tool work automatically.

The tool no longer works automatically. Run it before going to the Creations menu and after exiting the Creations menu - quit the game and run the tool before loading a saved game if you've installed new mods or updated mods in the Creations menu. No need to use the tool if you're just playing the game normally. Use the catalog backup and restore features instead of the repair features when possible.

Check button re-checks the file.

Clean button repairs the file. It may take a while with a large mod list.

Backup button copies ContentCatalog.txt to ContentCatalog.txt.bak. A previous backup if it exists will be overwritten without warning. Use the backup function before loading your saved game since this is when the corruption may occur. It's best to exit the game after making modifications to your installed mods, updating mods or changing the load order.

Restore button copies ContentCatalog.txt.bak to ContentCatalog.txt

Edit buttons are for opening ContentCatalog.txt or Plugins.txt files for editing with your default text editor.

Explore button opens the folder with your plugin and catalog files. You could manually edit the Plugins.txt file to enable or disable mods if needed. A * character indicates that a mod is enabled.

Load Order button shows a list of mods and allows them to be turned on or off or moved up or down in the load order. Some stats about your mods will be shown if you've used the Set Starfield Path button on the main screen.

You can alt-tab from the game to check the ContentCatalog file to see if corruption has occurred by pressing the Check button.

Two Starfield launch buttons are provided. One for the Steam version of the game and another for the MS Store version. The tool will close after using either of these launch buttons.

Quit the game if it's running before using the Clean or Edit buttons.
